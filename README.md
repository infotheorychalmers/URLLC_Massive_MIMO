# URLLC with Massive MIMO
This repository contains the matlab numerical routines used to produce the figures in the paper:

J. Östman, A. Lancho, G. Durisi and L. Sanguinetti "URLLC with Massive MIMO: Analysis and Design at Finite Blocklength",  *IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun.,* 2021. 

Please, cite the aforementioned paper if you use this code. 

## Content of the repository

This repository contains three folders corresponding to the sections of the paper where the figures appear. The main files to generate each figure are named as `sectionX_figX.m`.  Additional required files are also provided. 

The following auxiliary matlab files have been taken from the github repository [https://github.com/emilbjornson/massivemimobook](https://github.com/infotheorychalmers/URLLC_Massive_MIMO.git):
  
  - `functionChannelEstimates.m`
  - `functionCombinerPrecoder.m`
  - `functionExampleSetup.m`
  - `functionRlocalscattering.m`
